          <p>I use my üñå (I'm an artist, remember) across frontend, backend and (a bit) of devops. I think it's called
            Full-Stack Developer</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>I am not even kidding</p>

        <div>
          <p>I started my career working on an automated test tool for <a
              href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_stability_control">ESC</a> (Electronic Stability Control)
            in
            cars.
          </p>
          <p>If I were you, I would probably stick to walking, and as far as possible from the road!</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>I was once a CTO for a SaaS company</p>
          <p>Company made of 2 people, the CEO and the software developer!</p>
          <p>We eventually scaled to a company of 6 people, and that was my introduction to being a leader. Oh boy have
            I
            learned since then!</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>I am a technical writer, I like to write about the things I work on!</p>
          <p>I mostly write to myself though</p>
          <p>Here are the only <a
              href="https://dev.to/noejon/setting-up-a-node-js-development-environment-in-2-4eb1">only</a>2 <a
              href="https://dev.to/noejon/copying-a-git-repository-properly-j67">articles</a> I ever wrote (totally
            forgot
            about the second one TBH)</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>I kick ass at writing well tested and maintainable code, reviewing it and automating its deployment</p>
          <p>I'm also great at HTML/CSS/JavaScript, Typescript, JSON, git, etc, etc, etc. I like to think myself as
            adaptable to any
            technology/language</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>I am an avid reader. In the past few years I've been reading more than 200 books</p>
          <p>Amongst which you can find Grug, Baby All, My First Book, Peekaboo!</p>
          <p>Far from 200 books, but I wanted to grow as a leader and read lots of books about that. There are a few I
            keep coming back to, The manager's path from Camille Fournier, Resilient Management from Lara Hogan and The
            Coaching Habit from Michael Bungay Stanier</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>I take pride in seeing my team members grow and evolve in seniority over time.</p>
          <p>I also mentored and helped a few non-developers to make it to developer</p>
          <p>It definitely sparks more joy than tidying up my desk!</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>I'm also a chef level cook, but that probably does not interest you all that much, does it?</p>

          <p>Let's have a look at some badges, shall we?</p>
          <p>You probably did not scroll all that far, I can probably say whatever I want! Cucumber! ü•í</p>
          <p>Well if you are still around, here are the hard stats for you</p>
